\section{Conclusions}
After stating the problem setting of domain adaptation, We discuss about the target risk under unsupervised domain adaptation from theoretical viewpoint.
In the case of lacking target labels, $\HDH$-divergence is introduced to  measure the transferability between source and target domain.
Based on the theoretical result, a model called DANN is designed for unsupervised domain adaptation, which is an interesting example as an application of theoretical analysis.
